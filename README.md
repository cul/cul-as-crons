# CUL ArchivesSpace Crons

Scripts that are run against the ArchivesSpace API on a daily or weekly basis.

## Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* See requirements.txt

## Functionality

* Reporting scripts that can output to Google Sheets or a CSV file: report_accessions, report_agents, report_subjects, resource_reporter

## Setup

Create a file to hold credentials and filepaths. The easiest way to do this is to rename `local_settings.cfg.example` to `local_settings.cfg` and update it with your values.

## Contribution standards

### Style

This project uses the Python PEP8 community style guidelines. To conform to these guidelines, the following linters are part of the pre-commit:

* black formats the code automatically
* flake8 checks for style problems as well as errors and complexity
* isort sorts imports alphabetically, and automatically separated into sections and by type

After locally installing pre-commit, install the git-hook scripts in the project directory: ```pre-commit install```  

### Documentation

This project adheres to [Googleâ€™s docstring style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#381-docstrings). There are two types of docstrings: one-liners and multi-line docstrings. A one-line docstring may be perfectly appropriate for obvious cases where the code is immediately self-explanatory. Use multiline docstrings for all other cases.

### Tests

New code should  have unit tests. Tests are written in unittest style and run using [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/). To run the unit tests, specify the Python version using the `e` flag (see `tox.ini` for supported versions).
